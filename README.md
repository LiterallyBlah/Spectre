# Spectre

**Spectre** is a modular tool designed for web application reconnaissance and vulnerability analysis. It aims to integrate both browser-based interaction and external tools, such as Nikto and SQLmap, to provide comprehensive coverage of web application security testing.

## Features

- **SpectreCore**: The foundational module for handling browser sessions, authentication, and session management using tools like Playwright.
- **Dynamic Crawling**: Discover endpoints within web applications, both authenticated and unauthenticated.
- **Fuzzing Modules**: Automate fuzzing of input fields, headers, cookies, and more, with built-in session management.
- **External Tool Integration**: Integrate with external security tools such as Nikto, SQLmap, and Burp Suite.
- **Configurable Task Management**: Customise tasks via configuration files, defining inputs, expected outputs, and response analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LiterallyBlah/Spectre.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spectre
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Playwright browser drivers:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

## Usage

You can run **Spectre** through the main entry point:

```bash
python main.py
```

Spectre will load the configuration files and execute the tasks defined in `tasks.yaml`. Further documentation on customising tasks and integrating external tools will be available as the toolset evolves.

## Checklist of Progress

### Completed:
- [x] **Core Folder Structure**: Basic folder structure and files for the `core` module.
- [x] **Browser Session Management**: Initial setup for managing browser sessions using Playwright.
- [x] **Authentication Handling**: Set up initial authentication and session maintenance with cookies/tokens.
- [x] **Basic Configuration**: Set up basic configuration files, such as `tasks.yaml`.

### To Do:
- [ ] **Task Management**: Implement task management to handle user-defined tasks from `tasks.yaml`.
- [ ] **Session Continuity**: Build functionality to maintain sessions over extended periods.
- [ ] **Initial Fuzzing Setup**: Set up input fuzzing for forms, headers, and URLs.
- [ ] **External Tool Integration**: Begin integrating tools like Nikto and SQLmap.
- [ ] **Crawling and Endpoint Discovery**: Build out crawling functionality to automatically discover and parse web pages.
- [ ] **Advanced Fuzzing Modules**: Add optional fuzzing modules for headers, cookies, and custom parameters.
- [ ] **Response Analysis**: Implement LLM-based or regex-driven response pattern analysis.
- [ ] **Reporting System**: Set up output for results in JSON and HTML format.
- [ ] **Test Suite**: Implement unit tests for all core functionalities.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Provide detailed user and developer documentation for configuration and usage.

## Folder Structure

- `core/`: The core functionality of **Spectre**, managing browser sessions, authentication, and task management.
- `crawl/`: (Coming soon) Modules for dynamic crawling and endpoint discovery.
- `fuzz/`: (Coming soon) Modules for input fuzzing, header fuzzing, and more.
- `integrations/`: (Coming soon) Integrations with external tools like Nikto, SQLmap, and Burp Suite.
- `output/`: Output directory for generated reports and logs.
- `config/`: Configuration files such as `tasks.yaml` for defining the scope and structure of tasks.

## Future Development

This project is under active development, with additional modules and functionality planned, including enhanced crawling, response pattern analysis, and deeper integrations with security tools.
